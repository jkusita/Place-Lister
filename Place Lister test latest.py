# Project Idea: make some kind of game like an rpg! Add a thing on the game like if the program asks you something and you reply make the program wait using the printing command while printing out .... (periods to make the user think the program is thinking/takinghis time.)

# Program asks for a list and displays the things you need to do there.

# Make comment per each piece of code

# TO DO:
# 3. In the dictionary display an ordered number that numbers the items in each place so later the user can just put the number with the todo thing in an input that asks for the number to delete that thing off the place list.
# Make the code into functions to make it cleaner?
# Make it so that you can enter multiple input and like maybe you can tell the user to seperate it with something so that the program reads each seperator as a stop and interprets the next string as a new todo.
# Make like a back/reverse input. E.g. when you accidentally input addplace but you wanted to input display, you should be able to input in something so it goes back to asking you on what to do.
# Add a back input when you put ask then its goes to where are you going because it keeps on asking where are you going if the place isn't listed.
# Empty the dictionary later on, the key-value pairs are just there for testing purposes.

# What happens the user wants to input more than one todo's? (Think of a way)
# I think dictionary displays values in alphabetical order, no matter the time/precedence you added it to the dictionary. Find a way to disable this and display it in order from oldest to the most recently added.. 
# When you choose addtodo option, you should be able to have the choice to exit if you don't wan tot add a new one or existing. ####


# Make an option to display the current places or lists if they want/put an input when deleting places and/or todos so they can see what exists if they forget the things they want to delete.
#Find a way to save list because it discards the list after the program terminates.
# Maybe add a lower on all inputs so it's not so sensitive to cases? (Response: I'll think about it.)
# Make code pretty
# Make a website or some gui that runs this code maybe?
# Find out what is the different between addexisting and addtodo. If it's the same it's redundant, so delete one.
#Make an input that makes the user edit the names of the places like change BurgerKing to Burger King.
# Make the program output out somethinglike ("That place already exists, I just updated it witt he new todos") when using the todo input choice.
# Make the program output something if the choice isn't a parameter (or in some cases output something if it's a paramter to indicate that the command was succesful).
# Find out new names for the input choices xD!
# Find out a way to not put that extra space between the list and the line in display.
